Intermarriage between castes remains rare. Housing segregation by caste is rife. Of the top civil-service posts, only four are not held by high-caste Hindus. The toxicity of caste even extends to other religions. The forebears of nearly two-thirds of India's Catholics are Dalits who converted to escape the caste stigma. Yet among four cardinals and 31 archbishops, only two are of Dalit origin. Perhaps, India's quota programme is better than it's absence.</td>

It should establish a dialogic space with students in their language.

By 2030, the urban population in India will almost double to 630 million. If we are to facilitate this level of growth, we will need to upgrade our urban infrastructure considerably and horrific impact of COVID-19 on our cities has made this even more significant.

Today, they mostly cause trouble. Tit-for-tat clan feuds spatter blood across the Middle East and the Sahel. Tribes compete to control the state, often violently, so they can divvy up jobs and loot among their kin. Societies based on male bonding tend to subjugate women. A fifth of world's young women were married before the age of 18; a twentieth before 15. Issues related to women are tasks for national governments, but outsiders have some influence. Since western donors have started harping about girls' education, more girls have gone to school. Primary enrollment has risen from 64% in 1970 to nearly 90% today. Donors such as USAID and the World Bank have done a fair job of promoting property rights for women.

Judging, especially in the Hindu consciousness, has enjoyed an abiding association with Brahmins. While community elders mediated local disputes, lingering disagreements that reached higher forums involved Brahmins as judges. In princely courts, the officiating priests also performed adjudicative duties as royal advisors, jurisconsults or judges. But as the Anglo-Indian legal system expanded, the upper castes, especially Brahmins, assumed lower-level judgeships and populated key roles in the emerging legal professions. The cultural memory of Brahmins as judges deepened as modern courts imitated ancient custom. Till 1990, over forty percent of Supreme Court judges were Brahmins. The figure has since dipped slightly, but remains vastly disproportionate to their demographic representation in India. Today’s judges are yesterday’s Brahmins—and though not all modern-day judges belong to the Brahmin caste, they are all performing Brahmins. Just like a Brahmin is always a Brahmin, a judge, too, is always a judge.</td>

The fields in the Concurrent List were to be of common interest to the Union and the States, and the power to legislate on these subjects to be shared with the Union so that there would be uniformity in law across the country. However, one of the worst fears of Constituent Assembly member K.T.M. Ahmad Ibrahim Sahib Bahadur has now come true, with subjects in the Concurrent List being transferred to the Union List over a period of time due to the Union government’s high­ handedness. The essence of cooperative federalism lies in consultation and dialogue, and unilateral legislation without taking the States into confidence will lead to more protests on the streets.</td>

Vitalism is a shool of scientific thought which holds that life must be preserved at all costs. This has meant that a growing number of brain-dead patients are kept in hospital. Such cases can cause enormous distress to medical staff, especially the nurses  who care for patients hourly. Once doctors have established that further treatment is futile, the decision about what happens next is as much a moral judgment as a medical one. Drawing up policies to resolve such conflicts may be more difficult in a decentralised health system. Independent panels, appointed by the states, could offer more reassurance to grieving relatives.

Today, the government's narrative presents institutions like Parliament as governed by a set of abstract rules and regulations.

Another important method is for the judiciary to make deliberation a factor in evaluating the constitutional validity of laws. The judicial doctrine of "presumption of constitutionality" can be restrictively applied to cases where the State shows that laws and their consequences were carefully deliberated in the Parliament.

Palm oil plantations also generate income in rural areas through setting up of oil mills and packaging centres around palm oil-growing areas. Palm oil helps in fighting climate change through thick green cover and growing crops in multiple layers. However, it requires assured water supply, although it consumes only one-fourth of water as that of paddy. Many fear that with the entry of big corporates, palm oil cultivation extended to forest lands, but stringent forest laws provides very little scope for that.

The migrants are therefore exposed to varied vulnerabilities at different phases of the migration cycle: high recruitment costs and exploitation by illegal recruiting agents in the pre-migration phase, violation of the provisions of employment contracts, lack of effective social protection in destination countries, and lack of effective reintegration policies on return. There is a need to operationalise a migrant-centric policy architecture that could involve labour migration agreements with Gulf countries.</td>

Around 11% of Colombia's schools lack running water, making hand-washing impossible. The government has continued to pay teachers' salaries as they sit at home, so they have little incentive to get back to work. For the government, education is not a priority. Colombian students were already poorly served relative to their peers. Since the 2000s, the government has spent 4% of GDP on education, less than in other poor Latin American countries. As there are not enough state schools, around half of children attend school in shifts. Teachers are poorly paid; nearly a third of primary-school teachers do not have a degree. Although the data remains patchy, it seems many children may not bother to go back to school. Some teenagers are joining gangs. The pandemic and school closures could result in a lost generation.</td>

Yurok tribe, which lives along the lower stretch of Klamath River near the Pacific Ocean say that the number of salmon that enter the river to spawn had tumbled since outsiders first arrived en masse in the 1950s. Salmon fishing is now restricted. The salmons' decline has accelerated off-late. Reduced rainfall is partly to blame. This has lowered and warmed the river, a predicament exacerbated by sunlight-absorbing artificial lakes behind the dams. As a result, fish parasites and blooms of toxic algae that devour oxygen have flourished. The tribe evidently views the dams as "beacon of colonisation".</td>

One possible explanation for this is that party work as it exists today is highly masculinised, and women embedded in Tamil Nadu's largely patriarchal households are unable to meet its demands on their time.

During the pandemic, governments have been the main channel for information, the setters of rules, a source of cash and, ultimately, providers of vaccines. The renewed search for meaning reinforces the shift towards identity politics on both the right and the left. It is still unclear whether the appetite for risk is about to rebound. Even before coronavirus came along, the digital revolution, climate change and China's rise seemed to be bringing the post second World-War, Western-led order to an end.</td>

The larger context for the practice of dowry is the poor presence of women in their workforce, and their lack of financial independence. Millions of women's self-help groups have been quiet force for financial support in times of stress. However, near-exclusive focus on economic issues has been at the expense of social awareness and gender conscientisation.

Also, phasing away of Central Services Tax has led to major churning in the warehousing sector. Instead of having multiple warehouses in each State to avoid payment of CST through stock transfers, large companies are creating bigger warehouses located either near production sites or the consumption centre depending on the demands from the sector. The abolition of the entry tax has created a national common market by breaking down physical barriers at State borders. Further, the introduction of GST has led to the implementation of destination-based tax in which larger poorer consumption states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are likely to benefit, resulting in greater fiscal equity.</td>

The public imagination acquires superficiality when it seeks to focus on individual ethical initiatives to deal with difficulties rather than exercising the right to expose the limits of structures and hold the authorities that are as responsible as the structures in producing these unprecedented difficulties for the people. Cacophony can be defined in terms of the stark absence of reasoned debate or the presence of outright contempt for reason- and argument- based debate. However, the political function that such cacophony performs is to muffle the dissenting voices that cry for comprehensive protection and muzzle the legitimate cries of self-assertion, expression and dignified survival.</td>
