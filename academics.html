  <div id="000001" class="collapse">Lottocracy is a government of people by people recruited for office via a public lottery system. The lottery system would largely resemble the various systems in place today for choosing jury pools. The idea of lottocracy is not alien to India. In 1993, a constitutional amendment incorporated in which one-third of the seats were reserved for women. In each electoral cycle, specific seats are randomly identified for reservation. This is lottocracy at seat level.</div>

  <div id="000011" class="collapse">The term asymmetric federalism was first coined by Charles Tarlton in 1965. In strict and simple terms, asymmetrical federalism means a flexible type of union that grants special status to some of it's federative units. The asymmetric arrangement in Indian federalism has a long history and goes back to the way in which the British unified the country under their rule and later the way in which the territories under the direct control of the British and various principalities were integrated in the Indian union. Asymmetry in administrative, political and economic spheres in federal systems is unavoidable and in fact, may be necessary not only to ‘come together’ but also to ‘hold together’. However, while transparent asymmetric arrangements that can be justified on grounds of overall gains to the federation contribute to nation building, discriminatory policies followed purely on short term political gains can be inimical to the long term interests and stability of federalism.</div>

  <button class="terms" type="button" data-toggle= "collapser" data-target= "#000012">Climate Realism</button><br>
  <div id="000012" class="collapse">Climate realism acknowledges the significant difference between verifiable and replicable knowledge, and hypothetical knowledge based on indirect evidence. Climate realism’s principle contribution has been in providing an explanation for a lack of significant cooperation on climate change. It does so by identifying a moral limit after which collective action on climate change becomes politically implausible, regardless of the international architecture. This moral limit is based on power in terms of material capabilities, including the capability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change: highly industrialized states will be willing to engage in international cooperation on climate change, but only up to a point where the magnitude of resource transfers triggers relative-gains concerns. As a consequence, climate realism asserts that at a certain point states will favour attempts to increase their domestic adaptive capabilities at the expense of international cooperation because domestic adaptation will be more secure and independent of the dilemmas facing international mitigation and adaptation.</div>

  <button class="terms" type="button" data-toggle= "collapser" data-target= "#000013">Reputational Laundering</button><br>
  <div id="000013" class="collapse">Reputation laundering is the process of concealing the corrupt actions, past or present, of an individual, government or corporate entity, and presenting their character and behaviour in a positive light. This is done in order to gain legitimacy, privilege, influence and impunity from justice. It helps to disguise individual acts of corruption like bribes, kickbacks, extortion and embezzlement, or endemic corruption which can go on for a number of years on a national scale. Universities and think tanks in open settings are prime targets for reputation laundering. The rapid internationalisation of the higher education sector, as well as the swelling demand worldwide for Western education makes academic institutions particularly vulnerable to this form of transnational kleptocratic activity. Indeed, over recent years, there has been a major surge of foreign funding to U.S. and U.K. universities. The composition of fundraising has also changed. Major gifts comprise a growing share of donations, and a relatively small number of wealthy individuals contribute nearly 80 percent of gift-giving to universities.</div>

  <button class="terms" type="button" data-toggle= "collapser" data-target= "#000014">Astrotourism</button><br>
  <div id="000014" class="collapse">Astrotourism experience is based on human admiration, imagination and respect for space phenomena and it allows one to enjoy the value and beauty of silence at night, in darkness with the sight of a clear sky full of stars. Today, it is an emerging niche nature-based tourism. Since the emergence of modern tourism in the mid-19th century, the development of transportation has catalysed tourism. With COVID-19 and lockdowns, the undesirable effects of mass tourism have been realised. This has prompted rise in the popularity of astrotourism. This involves travelling to observe astronomical phenomena in dark sky areas- places far away from the effects of light pollution, for instance, into the mountains, deserts, or observatories. Typically, astrotourism as a hobby which has nothing to do with one’s profession or level of education. It is a unique tourism in which its greatest assets never need to be maintained or developed. It enables all rural localities, which are devoid of light pollution, to demonstrate offerings without any obligation to have spectacular planetarium or giant observatories and telescopes.</div>

  <button class="terms" type="button" data-toggle= "collapser" data-target= "#000015">Pollen Calendar</button><br>
  <div id="000015" class="collapse">Pollen calendars represent the time dynamics of airborne pollen taxa in graphical form in a particular geographical area.  It helps us understand the name of plant species that release pollen and spore at particular season(s). It also tells us the approximate amount of grains released in that season. Pollens are considered major outdoor airborne allergens responsible for allergic rhinitis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis in humans. Pollen calendars are location-specific, with concentrations closely related to locally distributed flora. They yield readily accessible visual details about various airborne pollen taxa present throughout the year, with their seasonality in a single picture. India is the first city in India to have a pollen calendar. This will help the city prepare early advisories and disseminate them through media channels to the citizens so that they can use protective gear during the period when the concentration of allergic pollens are going to be high.</div>

  <button class="terms" type="button" data-toggle= "collapser" data-target= "#000016">Climate Famine</button><br>
  <div id="000016" class="collapse">Farmers are resilient and frequently adapt to changes in weather. However, climate change creates conditions outside of human experience, challenging farmers’ ability to adapt. Repetitive drought shocks led to severe vegetation stress resulting in lower crop productivity. At present, Madagascar is reported to experience climate-induced famine. Madagascar normally experiences frequent droughts and is often affected by the change in weather patterns caused by El Niño. Southern Madagascar has been experiencing drought consecutively for the last four years. Over southern Madagascar temperature has been steadily climbing since the 1950’s and though it was also significantly warmer in the early part of the century, temperatures in the year 2000 are approximately 0.2°C warmer. This has resulted in lower crop production- They have reported below-average rice, maize, and pulse production in the main producing areas along with very poor cassava production, a staple food. Increasing temperatures are disrupting global weather patterns that farmers have relied upon for centuries.</div>

  <button class="terms" type="button" data-toggle= "collapser" data-target= "#000017">Vitalism</button><br>
  <div id="000017" class="collapse">Modern day medical history is aware of dangers of utilitarianism learnt from the experiences during World War and reflections on ethnic cleansing of neurologically vulnerable, poor and genetically "impure". This has resulted in leaning towards, vitalism, a school of scientific thought that attempts to explain the nature of life as resulting from a vital force peculiar to living organisms and different from all other forces found outside living things. Vitalism strongly believes that life must be preserved at all costs and the value of human life is not be measured on the basis of external quality-of-life judgements. Coupled with rapid increase in use of extracorporeal membrane-oxygenation machines, which helps keep patients alive when their heart or lungs (or both) do not work, this has resulted in rise in the number of brain-dead patients kept in today's hospital. It has also sparked a excruciating conflicts between doctors and relatives of the patient over withdrawal of life-sustaining interventions for palliative-care patients at hospitals.</div>

  <button class="terms" type="button" data-toggle= "collapser" data-target= "#000018">Shadow Docket</button><br>
  <div id="000018" class="collapse">The shadow docket is a term used by legal observers to describe the use of emergency orders and summary decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States without the opportunity of oral argument. This term was coined by Will Baude of the University of Chicago in 2015. It includes emergency appeals from parties who believe they would be irreparably harmed without quick intervention from the justices. There has been a spike in shadow docket cases involving issues of national importance at present in US, including battles over election rules and public health measures to fight Covid-19. In these cases, there is very little interaction and deliberation between the court and participants. Shadow docket decisions significantly departs from the usual principles of appellate process. These decisions are generally terse (often only a few sentences), unsigned, and are preceded by little to no oral arguments. This highlights the deficit of accountability and transparency.</div>

  <div id="000020" class="collapse">Supersymmetry is a phenomenon which gives coherence to the current, rather ad hoc explanation of the menagerie of fundamental particles that has been collected since the 1890s. The particles we currently know to exist are divided into two categories: fermions and bosons. In supersymmetric theories, each particle has an as-yet undiscovered “superpartner” with many similar properties. Fermions are paired with bosons and vice-versa. The idea of a symmetry between fermions and bosons originated in the early 1970s to address a mathematical issue with string theory. The string theory postulates that everything is finally made up of infinitesimally small objects which are conceptualised by those without the maths to understand them properly as taut, vibrating strings. The experiments at the Large Hardon (Electron-Positron) Collider near Geneva, which operated from 1989 to 2000, has cast doubt even on the simplest supersymmetric models.</div>

  <div id="000025" class="collapse">Manpower outsourcing is a business practice in which an entity hires a third-party to perform tasks, handle operations or provide services for them. Since September 11, 2001, national security, disaster relief, prison management, environmental monitoring, and many other functions of government have been outsourced, worldwide. In such contracting-out of government services, the functions themselves remain public. This is different from privatisation, in that, privatization relates to the functions the market does on it's own without any direct role of government. In outsourcing, the government retains control of certain functions but performs them through private subordinates. Ironically, today, we have reached a state wherein routine jobs continue to be performed internally by government, whereas complex assignments involving matters of judgment and supervision have been given over to contractors. One of the major cause for this inversion is lobbying by public sector unions.</div>

  <button class="terms" type="button" data-toggle= "collapser" data-target= "#000026">Social Rental Housing</button><br>
  <div id="000026" class="collapse">Social Rental Housing is defined as rental accommodation in which the rent is set at a level below market rates to make it affordable for people considered disadvantaged, such as low-income earners, the elderly, the disabled, and the migrants. The difference between the market rent and the subsidised rent is sometimes obtained through subsidies to the landlord. In other cases, it is provided by the owner of a religious institution, charity, NGO, or public entity owns the property. Rental housing is a critical enabler of household and city economic development. Public sector agencies in India have provided social rental housing for their own employees for several decades. West Bengal was one of the pioneers in the creation of rental housing estates (RHE) in several urban districts in the 1960s and 1970s. Conceived as a Slum Prevention Programme (SPP), the MMRDA-RHS was intended towards creating a large amount of public social rental housing which would provide adequate housing to in-migrating low-income labour in the Mumbai region.</div>

  <button class="terms" type="button" data-toggle= "collapser" data-target= "#000027">Cluster Development Approach</button><br>
  <div id="000027" class="collapse">Clusters are defined as "geographical concentrations of inter-connected enterprises and associated institutions that face common challenges and opportunities". Clusters consist of a critical mass of enterprises located in geographical proximity to each other. Enterprises within a cluster share many common features. Governments worldwide regard clusters as potential drivers of enterprise development and innovation. Cluster initiatives are also considered to be efficient policy instruments in that they allow for a concentration of resources and funding in targeted areas with a high growth and development potential that can spread beyond the target locations (spillover and multiplier effects). Examples of internationally renowned clusters include the Silicon Valley cluster in California, the information technology cluster of Bangalore in India and the Australian and Chilean wine clusters. Relatively few clusters in the developing world have been able to achieve high and sustained growth rates. In many cases, the clusters are trapped in a cycle of cut-throat competition, stagnation and poverty and are unable to spontaneously achieve the transition to innovation and growth.</div>

  <button class="terms" type="button" data-toggle= "collapser" data-target= "#000028">Enhanced Efficiency Fertilizer</button><br>
  <div id="000028" class="collapse">Agricultural expansion of modern agriculture resulted from the excessive application of agrochemical fertilizers, which have led to processes such as eutrophication, water toxicity, groundwater pollution, air pollution, soil degradation and even ecosystem change which brings up questions on the sustainability of modern agriculture. "Enhanced Efficiency Fertilizer" (EEF) is a term for new formulations that control fertilizer release or alter reactions that reduce nutrient losses to the environment. EEF systems offer an effective way to improve nutrient efficiency, minimize fertilizer losses by physical, chemical and biological processes. Examples of such materials are: Slow Release Fertilizer (SRF), which releases the nutrient slower than a common fertilizer; and Controlled Release Fertilizer (CRF), when factors as release rate, pattern and release period can be controlled during its use. EEF is an important addition to a system of conservation practices that helps reduce the impact from row crop agriculture on the environment, while maintaining or increasing agricultural productivity and profitability.</div>

  <button class="terms" type="button" data-toggle= "collapser" data-target= "#000029">Community Policing</button><br>
  <div id="000029" class="collapse">COVID-19 presents a global challenge not only for law enforcement, but also for society as a whole. Stress, financial insecurity, difficult living conditions or ill health, imposed by the pandemic can contribute to making violence more likely. The concept of community policing is based on the belief that the police officers and private citizens working together in creative ways can help solve contemporary community problems related to crime, social and physical disorder and neighbourhood decay. This involves a recognition by the police that community is the best resource as well as it's greatest ally in the fight against crime and that establishment of partnership is crucial for drawing upon this resource. India’s public health response to Covid-19 engaged the police in two distinct ways: First, in maintenance of public order and second, in provision of social services. The enforcement of lockdown measures in the country mandated that police forces become a bridge between the community and distribution networks.</div>

  <button class="terms" type="button" data-toggle= "collapser" data-target= "#000030">Rank Sexism</button><br>
  <div id="000030" class="collapse">Sexism is linked to power in that those with power are typically treated with favour and those without power are typically discriminated against. Sexist assumptions about women and men, which manifest themselves as gender stereotypes, can rank one gender as superior to another. Such hierarchical thinking can be conscious and hostile, or it can be unconscious, manifesting itself as unconscious bias. Rank Sexism can touch everyone, but women are particularly affected. When a man calls a woman a girl, he places his association in that relationship as either father or boy. Clearly, what is at issue is power. A woman is a female who has a sense of her own identity and personal power, as well as a sense of her sexuality. A girl is an immature female, a child, whose sexuality is not threatening. Rank Sexism is also related to stereotypes since discriminatory actions or attitudes are frequently based on false beliefs or generalisations about gender, and on considering gender as relevant where it is not.</div>

  <button class="terms" type="button" data-toggle= "collapser" data-target= "#000031">Niche Tourism</button><br>
  <div id="000031" class="collapse">The term niche may be used when a particular social group occupies a space or when a subculture occupies a specific niche within a larger community by appropriating specific places or infrastructure. Niche tourism refers to how a specific tourism product can be tailored to meet the needs of a particular audience/market segment. Niche tourism, through image creation, helps destinations to differentiate their tourism products and compete in an increasingly competitive and cluttered tourism environment. Niche tourism can take a geographical or demographic approach, product-related approach or consumer-related approach. This tourism is in contrast to mass-market approach of traditional tourism that targeted entire marketplaces, such as specific countries or regions with "one size fits all" experiences. Some examples of niche tourism include adventure tourism, bicycle tourism, sports tourism, gaming tourism, pro-poor tourism, or geotourism.</div>

  <button class="terms" type="button" data-toggle= "collapser" data-target= "#000032">Strategic Partnership Model</button><br>
  <div id="000032" class="collapse">Strategic Partnership model is designed to build indigenous manufacturing capacity by creating an industrial ecosystem. Strategic Partnering identifies where the value potential exists for the buying team by pursuing a partnership-based (joint working) approach and selects private partners to make necessary long term investments in manufacturing infrastructure, an eco-system of suppliers, skilled human resources, R&D for modernization and upgrades as well as and other capabilities, besides production of equipment. Such Strategic Partners are expected to play the role of System Integrator by building an extensive eco-system comprising development partners, specialised vendors and suppliers, in particular, those from the MSME sector. This model is to be adopted for boosting indigenous defence manufacturing capabilities for defence procurement in India is a monopsony with the government being the sole buyer.</div>

  <button class="terms" type="button" data-toggle= "collapser" data-target= "#000033">Occupational Licensing</button><br>
  <div id="000033" class="collapse">Occupational licensing is the process by which governments establish qualifications required to practice a trade or profession, so that only licensed practitioners are allowed by law to receive pay for doing work in the occupation. In 1960s and 1970s, majority of the licensed occupations comprised of doctors, dentists and lawyers. Presently, certain licensed occupations are turning into glorified guilds. To be a certified chartered accountant in India, one must have three years of articled training and pass an examination. Also, occupational licensing places limits on the activities that the licensees are legally allowed to perform as part of that profession such as demonstrating good moral character, working with or for local practitioners, and engaging in ongoing professional development activities (an investment that continues throughout the worker’s career). Sometimes, it could also hamper mobility, acting as a deterrent to geographical movement. Contractual work comes along with "non-compete" clauses preventing workers from easily leaving their jobs for high paying ones.</div>

  <div id="000035" class="collapse">Eco-Fundamentalism is a doctrine that demands absolute priorities for nature conservation which are to override human aspirations, such as freedom, prosperity, security and justice. Some in the environmental debate try to place environmental conservation above all other human interests. They see human beings as an integral part of an interdependent physical system and argue in terms of purely quantitative, physical trade-offs between human demands and the demands of animals, plants and other elements of the physical world. The eco-fundamentalist school rejects the argument that human concerns and valuations alone should be the measure of all human activity. Instead, it tries to place the interests of animals and eco-systems on an equal footing with human interests. The eco-fundamentalist school of thought also advocates an extreme interpretation of the "precautionary principle" in ecology, namely that no harm should be done to the natural environment, whatever the consequences to other human aspirations.</div>

  <div id="000036" class="collapse">Sometimes, translation of a real-life problem into a mathematical form can give a better representation and solution of certain problems. The process of translation is called Mathematical Modelling. Mathematical model is defined as "a mathematical framework representing variables and their interrelationships to describe observed phenomena or predict future events". Mathematical modelling is an essential tool for understanding the world. In olden days, the Chinese, Egyptians, Indians, Babylonians and Greeks indulged in understanding and predicting the natural phenomena through their knowledge of mathematics. The use of Mathematics in solving real-world problems has become widespread especially due to the increasing computational power of digital computers and computing methods, both of which have facilitated the handling of lengthy and complicated problems.</div>

  <div id="000037" class="collapse">Ranked Choice Voting (RCV), sometimes called "instant runoff voting" or "preferential voting", is a proven voting method that is designed to accommodate more than two choices in elections. Rather than pick just one candidate, voters get to rank several in order of preference. Even if a voter’s top choice doesn’t have enough support to win, their rankings of other candidates still play a role in determining the victor. RCV upholds majority rule while accommodating increased voter choice. It creates incentives for winning candidates to reach out to all voters. Based on the context of its use, RCV can mitigate partisan inflexibility, foster greater accountability for incumbents, increase civic engagement, and reduce the impact of campaign spending. It could become a candidate-based form of proportional representation that expands the percentage of people who elect preferred candidates, increase competition, and provide a natural means to elect more diverse legislatures.</div>

  <div id="000038" class="collapse">The health effects of heat are often described better by a combination of temperature and humidity, such as a heat index or wet bulb temperature. Wet Bulb Temperature is the lowest temperature to which something can be cooled through evaporation from its surface. There are many different definitions of heat waves. Most meteorological organisations have very different official definitions, tailored to local conditions and stakeholders, usually based on maximum temperature and duration. In more sophisticated definitions, the temperature and duration index may be accompanied by humidity, as humid heat waves pose a greater threat to human health. A simple measure that includes this is the wet bulb temperature of the human body. It is a measure of how well the human body can cool itself via evaporation of sweat from the skin. The second definition we use is the monthly maximum of the daily maximum of the wet bulb temperature as a measure that combines heat and humidity and indicates how well the body can dissipate heat through perspiration.</div>

  <div id="000039" class="collapse">The Variable Interest Entity is a structure that consists of several corporate entities linked together through a mix of contractual relationships and equity ownership for the purpose of convincing shareholders of an offshore company that they own interest in the Chinese operating business, while simultaneously appearing to the Chinese government as though no illegal foreign ownership of the operating company exists. The People's Republic of China regulatory body for foreign investment, Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) outrightly limits or prohibits foreign ownership (and therefore, equity-based investment) in strategically important sectors. As a result of these restrictions, certain Chinese companies adopted a corporate structure- known today as a VIE structure- to circumvent Chinese law in order to facilitate foreign investment in "restricted" and "prohibited" industries. The VIE structure achieves the dual purpose of giving Chinese companies access to Western capital, whilst simultaneously allowing Western investors access to Chinese stocks.</div>

  <div id="000041" class="collapse">Mezzanine finance is a hybrid of debt and equity. It is a debt capital with fixed payment or repayment requirements, but with the right to convert to an equity interest in a company. This financing carries two advantages: first, it attracts investors by offering a rate of return which is higher than that of senior debt and second, on the balance sheet of a company, it is treated like quasi-equity, which makes it easier to increase the component of the usual bank or financial institution loans. Also, since subordinated debt is not a loan, Financial Institutions do not insist on escrow backing for such funding. Mezzanine finance is typically found with venture capital companies and/or alternative lending institutions seeking a higher rate of return. In the developed world, many infrastructure projects are part-funded through ‘mezzanine finance’. An impediment to the use of mezzanine financing in India is the lack of a sufficiently large and varied pool of infrastructure projects.</div>

  <div id="000042" class="collapse">Serosurvey is a suitably stratified, high-quality serological survey that is obtained in order to estimate the susceptibility profile of a population to a particular disease. Serosurveys measure population immunity resulting from vaccination programmes (routine services and campaigns) or through natural infection (outbreaks). It helps to understand the proportion of population exposed to viral infection, including asymptomatic individuals. The high quality serosurveys require that serum samples be collected from individuals that accurately represent the target population, usually achieved by conducting a probability household survey; that appropriate, standardized laboratory methods with excellent quality assurance and control be used; and that data be appropriately analysed and interpreted. This requirement is particularly important in low incidence/highly vaccinated populations, where there is no exposure to wild virus to boost immunity. Serosurveys are the most direct and potentially least biased way to estimate the susceptibility profile of a population.</div>

  <div id="000044" class="collapse">Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses in animals and humans. Spike protein is the one that adorns the outer envelope of these particles. Coronaviruses receive their name from a crown (corona, in Latin) of spikes made of protein that cover the surface of the virus. The spike protein allows the virus to enter the cells by binding to a receptor called 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2' (ACE2) that sits on the surface of some cells. The structural characteristics of virus coat is highly relevant to virus propagation because shape is almost everything in the world of proteins. It is through their shape that proteins recognise one another. It is through changes of shape that they act. Therefore, majority of COVID-19 vaccines target the spike protein. The vaccines expose the body to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, thereby training the immune system to respond more rapidly and effectively when it encounters the virus in the future.</div>

  <div id="000045" class="collapse">Miyawaki, also called the Potted Seedling Method, is an afforestation technique pioneered by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki. It helps build dense, native forests in urban areas. Dr. Miyawaki's insight was to deconstruct and rebuild the process of ecological succession, by which bare land develops into a mature forest. Usually, the first arrival is grass. Shrubs sprout later, followed by small trees and, finally, larger ones. Incipient and mature woodlands therefore contain different species. The Miyawaki method skips some of these early phases and jumps directly to planting the kind of species found in a mature wood. As the results are tangible and immediate, many Indian cities such as Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai and Tirunelveli have adopted this idea.</div>

They artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations where there is little or no economic activity or to erode tax bases through deductible payments such as interest or royalties. Although some of the schemes used are illegal, most are not. When taxpayers see multinational corporations legally avoiding income tax, it undermines voluntary compliance by all taxpayers. BEPS is of major significance for developing countries due to their heavy reliance on corporate income tax, particularly from multinational enterprises. It is estimated that BEPS practices cost countries USD 100-240 billion in lost revenue annually.</div>

It is normally understood that consumer’s behaviour is influenced by both their perceived risk of disclosing their information and the trust they have with the company. But, in reality, the consumers freely divulge personal information in exchange for services and convenience. Some people do it because they find it difficult to associate a specific value to their privacy and therefore, the value of protecting it. While some others do not consider their personal information to be their own and thus might not appreciate the need to secure it.

Western Pacific’s temperatures have risen over the past few decades as compared to that of the Eastern Pacific, creating major pressure differences that drive winds across the entire ocean. The pressure change leads to warm air, heated by the ocean surface, rise over the western Pacific, and decreases convection over the central and eastern Pacific.

  <div id="000072" class="collapse">'Tangping' in Chinese means 'Lying Flat': Describing this philosophy as an antidote to stressful life, one internet user posted: "Two vegetarian meals each day. A monthly budget of 200 yuan ($30). Working just two months a year".  The idea of Tangping began trending across China's young generation, resonating especially with millennials born after the 1990s and Gen Z. Tangping describes a longing to escape the pressures of modern life in China, where young people are expected to work long hours, buy property, get married and have children. Such idea is at odds with the Communist Party's political culture that encourages people to throw their all into work, for the good of their country. Tangping, therefore, conveys a whiff of dissent. A popular online comment suggested that Tangping had come to mean opting out, with defiance: "Lying flat is standing up, horizontally. Lying flat is having a backbone".</div>

It is a revolutionary technology which can help in manipulating biological organisms and processes for human betterment, especially in treating diseases, by reengineering cells. But it is a double- edged sword. At present, bio-defence research routinely uses pathogens and toxins for experimental purposes, processes and know-how. The outcomes of bio-defence research could potentially be used to create bio-weapons especially with new advancements in synthetic biology. Also, there are many risks associated with the technology which must be addressed before it becomes widely accessible.</div>

  <div id="000075" class="collapse">"Newsworthiness Allowance" is a clause in Facebook’s policies allows certain posts by "news outlets, politicians, or other people" to remain on the platform even if they are in violation of its rules. This clause was introduced by Facebook in October 2016 after the social media giant received global criticism for removing the iconic "Napalm Girl" photo. According this clause, the social media giant accords special value to content that surfaces imminent threats to public health or safety or that gives voice to perspectives currently being debated as part of a political process. The clause has been controversial, and many saw it as being partial towards politicians and public figures. Facebook has recently reversed it's stand on this. It will hereafter not provide such allowance normally. That is, it will not treat content posted by politicians any differently from posts by anyone else. It will also “begin publishing the rare instances" when a newsworthiness clause is applied to a post. </div>

  <div id="000076" class="collapse">Pandemic fatigue is demotivation to follow recommended protective behaviours, emerging gradually over time and is affected by a number of emotions, experiences and perceptions. This happens when increasing number of people do not sufficiently follow recommendations and restrictions related to the pandemic and decrease their efforts to keep themselves informed about it. They have lower risk perceptions related to the disease. When acutely stressful circumstances drag on for a long time, the perceived threat of the pathogen may decrease as people become used to its existence. At the same time, the perceived loss resulting from the pandemic response (lockdowns, restrictions) is likely to increase over time as people experience the long-term personal, social and potentially economic consequences of restrictions. For some people, the balance may shift, and the perceived costs of the response may start to outweigh the perceived risks related to the pathogen. This results in Pandemic fatigue.</div>

  <div id="000078" class="collapse">Network effect is a phenomenon whereby a product or service gains additional value as more people use it. Internet, Fax machines, Social media (Facebook, Twitter) are examples of the network effect. The network effect originated in the early 20th century, with the advent of the telephone. When the profitability of a hardware company depends on the number of compatible softwares available in the market for that particular hardware, it results in greater sales. This in turn, increases market demand and enhances software profitability. If the network effect dominates, then all software firms will jump on the bandwagon and use the same hardware. This would result in de facto standardization. Congestion is a negative network effect whereby too many users can slow a network down, reducing its utility and frustrating network members.</div>

However, even small increases in Black Carbon emissions and deposition can lead to increased snow melt and sublimation rates, decreased snow albedo and reflectivity, and large net climate radiative forcing. Continuous measurements of Black Carbon aerosols carried out at different geographic locations over the Himalayan regions indicate significant Black Carbon concentrations in the atmosphere during the pre-monsoon period.</div>

ERC-721 variates significantly from the ERC-20 standard as it extended the common interface for tokens to ensure that tokens based on it are distinctly non-fungible and thus unique. This particularly improves the tokenization of individual assets which is not feasible with fungible tokens.
